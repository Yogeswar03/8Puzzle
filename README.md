# ðŸ§© 8-Puzzle Solver (A* Search Algorithm)

This project implements an A* search algorithm to solve the classic **8-puzzle problem**, using the **misplaced tiles heuristic** (number of tiles not in the correct position). It finds the shortest path from the initial configuration to the goal configuration.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Description

The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space (represented as `0`). The tiles can slide into the empty space to reach the goal configuration.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Implements **A\*** Search Algorithm.
- Heuristic: **Number of misplaced tiles**.
- Priority queue for efficient state exploration using `heapq`.
- Displays the step-by-step path from the initial state to the solution.
